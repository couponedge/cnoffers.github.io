                <main class="paragraph">


                    <p>In 1 word &ldquo;YES&rdquo; it is worth the money they charge.</p>
                    <p>Let me explain in-depth how it is worth.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Firstly understand that Coding Ninjas don&rsquo;t just charge for their videos there are many
                        other benefits you get along it which separates it from other similar sites which provides
                        similar courses at low price.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Let me explain it with my own experience:</p>
                    <p>I joined coding ninjas competitive programming course when I was at std 12 because I wanted to
                        participate in IOI which is International Olymipads in Informatics. It has same syllabus as
                        competitive programming. And That time I only knew some basic Data Structures. And could not
                        find anyone to guide me for it. Hence I searched online and get to know about coding ninjas
                        course.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>After explaining my parents why I needed that course, my parents allowed me to purchase the
                        course which cost me around Rs 10000/-. At that time I didn&rsquo;t knew much and struggled a
                        lot in problem solving but with time improved a lot.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <img src="../assets/blog/cp-certificate.png" alt="course completion certificate">
                    <p><strong>Teaching Assistance </strong>: During the course whenever I have doubt regardless of how
                        silly doubt it was, I can always raise a doubt and get response within 10 minutes to 1 hour
                        mostly.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>Content </strong>: The best thing I liked about coding ninjas was I don&rsquo;t had to
                        google around for different topics, All the topics are already covered with enough problems to
                        practice, sorted in increasing difficulty order which makes learning so easy.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>Result </strong>: After completing I gave my ZCO (zonal computing olympiads) exam and got
                        selected for the Next Level.</p>
                    <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>Improvement in competitive sites</strong>: After the course i was now able to solve
                        medium level problems and improve my ranking, before the course I used to stuck after solving
                        1<sup>st</sup> two problems but now I can solve more problems.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>Problem Setting</strong>: Apart from this best part till now was I had also set few
                        problems on codechef contest now.</p>
                    <img src="../assets/blog/jvphobia-problem.png" alt="Codechef problem setting">
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Moreover, after the completion of the course, Coding Ninjas provides Internship and Job
                        opportunities in various companies including Coding Ninjas itself. I&nbsp;<strong>applied for
                            Teaching Assistant Internship in Coding Ninjas&nbsp;</strong>after the completion of my
                        course.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <img src="../assets/blog/cn-jobs.png" alt="coding ninjas jobs">

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>The selection was based on a Coding Test which I passed easily and got selected as a Teaching
                        Assistant. My role is to help other students in code/concepts in the course which I completed
                        recently. So, this&nbsp;<strong>Internship provided me complete revision of the course</strong>.
                        It is a paid internship and providing me a stipend of 30k.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <img src="../assets/blog/taship-email.png" alt="Teaching Assistance Job Mail">
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>So, overall I invested 10k in the course and in return I learnt a lot and got an internship of
                        30k. Hence, it proved to be a value for money deal !</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Therefore, if you are interested in any of the course provided by Coding Ninjas, don&rsquo;t
                        think much&hellip;. Just go for it and trust me .. you won&rsquo;t regret on your decision !!
                    </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>It is an investment for upskilling yourself !!</strong></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>If you still have any doubt, you may take a&nbsp;<strong>Free Trial of any
                            course</strong>&nbsp;of your choice to experience all the features along with
                        a&nbsp;<strong>Certificate of Completion</strong>.</p>
                        <br>
                    <p>I am telling you in brief all those things about the course, which I personally liked the most
                        and I think that you should also know these things -</p>
                    <p><strong>Placement Assistance -&nbsp;</strong>After completing the course, Coding Ninjas ensures
                        that you should get the right track in future. It provides various internships and jobs
                        opportunities with a good stipend. With the help of these, you can get back your course fees
                        within a month. So, I consider it just like an investment !!</p>
                        <br>
                    <p><strong>Teaching Assistance -</strong>&nbsp;If in case you have any problem or doubt regarding
                        any topic, concept, question or anything, you can ask in from the teaching assistant. They
                        explain you the solution very clearly. You may ask them any doubt as many time as you want. You
                        will definitely get the solution within few hours.</p>
                        <br>
                    <p><strong>CODEZEN -</strong>&nbsp;CODEZEN is an online platform specially made for all the students
                        of Coding Ninjas to practice. It contains various sections like blogs, test section, events
                        section, leaderboards etc. It allows all the students of Coding Ninjas to compete among
                        themselves.</p>
                        <br>

                    <p><strong>Refer &amp; Earn Scheme -</strong>&nbsp;I personally loved this scheme a lot. After
                        taking the course, you can refer other students to take Coding Ninjas courses. You can provide
                        them 1000 rupees additional discount and you also get 1000 rupees in your wallet which you can
                        use to buy further courses.</p>
                        <br>
                    <p><strong>Hint Videos -</strong>&nbsp;Almost all the problems are backed up by a hint video. If you
                        face any problem in any assignment question, you can see the video which explains the concept
                        used to solve the problem. But you need to do the coding part yourself.</p>
                        <br>
                    <p><strong>Goodies -</strong>&nbsp;Coding Ninjas also provide goodies to all the enrolled students.
                        These goodies are really AWESOME. It includes a wildcraft bag, a coding ninjas t-shirt and some
                        laptop stickers.</p>
                        <br>
                    <p>I think this would be enough for you to decide yourself whether the courses worth for the money
                        or not !!</p>

                    <br>
