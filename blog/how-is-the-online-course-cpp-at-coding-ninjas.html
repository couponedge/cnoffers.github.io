                    <p>Hey, to put my experience in just a sentence:</p>
                    <p><strong><em>&ldquo;Blew expectations out of proportion.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>SHORT ANSWER:</strong></p>
                    <p>This course is just awesome. I see many people who waste a lot of their time finding reviews and
                        motivation on Quora and end up nowhere. So I recommend you not to do it and if you want to learn
                        anything in programming join Coding Ninjas for sure. You can just visit <a
                            href="https://cnoffers.github.io/">CNOffers</a> and get Rs.1200
                        off on any online course. It will be applied automatically on all the courses. It will help you
                        for sure ;)</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>LONG ANSWER:</strong></p>
                    <p>I can vividly recall the first lecture and the introduction of the course which was very
                        impressive and I was hooked.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I learned a lot during the first month and I was very satisfied with the course, "It couldn't be
                        better" I thought to myself but little did I know that it would only get better in the second
                        month with Data Structures.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I had learned so much in just the first two weeks that it blew my mind. I was exposed to the
                        underlying interrelation of concepts which I didn't know existed until this point in time.</p>
                    <p>Most courses grow dull over time and you only continue studying to make the most out of it and
                        the money that you've spent. But with Coding Ninjas it was nothing of the sort. The reason why I
                        kept on with it wasn't to justify the monetary value for my own sake but because of how
                        thrilling the experience was.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>And that was my experience with the course. It was immensely helpful to me as a CS student and
                        more than that it was one hell of an experience! I have never enjoyed a study course so much.
                        The expectations I initially had were blown out of proportion by this point. Below are some of
                        the points about the course.</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Course Structure:</b> There were assignments, following the lectures, which helped
                            reinforce the
                            learning of the complex concepts which lead to tests that would either raise you up the
                            leaderboard or down which was very motivating and functioned to drive me to work harder in
                            order to climb higher on the leaderboard.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Support System:</b> One of the best aspects of this course was the TA support who were
                            immensely
                            helpful and you can contact them at any time to help you move along with the course.
                            Additionally, there was also a WhatsApp group which was great to resolve doubts and queries.
                            I usually got the response from the group right at the moment, whether it was from a mentor
                            or my peers.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b><u>
                            <p>There are 5 things that make this course the ideal choice if you want to learn :</p>
                        </u></b>
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Online courses help you build resistance and concentration and boost your self learning
                            power.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>The TA support you get is just AWESOME. Tas are available at every point of the time and you
                            can contact them, they will respond accordingly.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Its more challenging than offline programs. Once you step out of your comfort zone, things
                            will get ugly. The course structure is well designed, spreading easy problems evenly with
                            medium and harder problems to help you find motivation to just go on. Trust me, if you are
                            motivated enough to read this article on Quora this long, you will sail through the course
                            easily. Its quiet well designed and has exactly the same content as offline course so it
                            wont be too easy too. Even after one year of coding, I still bit my nails on some test
                            problems at the end of this course. Be sure to be strong, things are going to get rough if
                            you take the course. But it will be fun:)</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Its quiet flexible and you will literally find how to program dynamically :P Programming
                            dynamically for my non CS friends means that you will be coding like crazy, whenever you
                            have time. To be clear, you wont code like usual person learns in class, 4 hours of class
                            and then revise. NO!!!.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Its fast and won&rsquo;t let you fell boredom. The lectures are unlocked as you proceed but
                            not too slow. Every assignment is bounded by a deadline, which you should not miss.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br>
                    <p>The mentors are very cool as individuals and exceptional teachers. They break down complex
                        concepts to core ideas in a way that makes it way easier to grasp them.</p>
